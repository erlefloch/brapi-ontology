# brapi-ontology
Provides a base definition for each BrAPI term and open definition discussion/validation with the BrAPI community. The purpose is to have every BrAPI term (fields, data types) defined and linked to an ontology. A secondary goal would be to have example values for each data type fields.

The BrAPI Data Type Browser can be accessed through this URL (github dev):
